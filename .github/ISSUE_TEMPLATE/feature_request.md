## **Description**
A clear and concise description of the feature you would like to see implemented.

> Example: Add an undo button to allow players to revert their last move.

---

## **Why This Feature is Needed**
Explain why this feature would be beneficial to the game, improving gameplay, user experience, or addressing a specific problem.

> Example: Sometimes players accidentally make a wrong move, and having an undo button would improve the overall experience by allowing them to correct their mistake.

---

## **Proposed Solution**
Describe how this feature could be implemented. Include any relevant details or examples.

> Example: Add an "Undo" button to the user interface. When clicked, the game should restore the grid and score to the state before the last move.

## **Alternatives Considered**
If applicable, mention any alternative solutions or features youâ€™ve considered and why they may not be suitable.

> Example: Instead of an undo button, we could add a "Redo" feature, but it may complicate the user interface.

## **Additional Context**
Add any other details, mockups, or screenshots that might help explain the feature.

> Example: 
- Provide a visual mockup of the undo button placement.
- Suggest keyboard shortcuts for quick undo (e.g., "Ctrl+Z").
